# Ford GoBike
## by Gabriela Garcia


## Dataset

> I used Data from uses of the Ford GoBike service in the San Francisco Bay area in 2018. This data set carried data bout use instances of the server, with information about stations, user type, a time. This data was split up by month which allowed me to compare monthly datasets.

## Summary of Findings

> I found that summer and fall months tend to be the most popular time to use this service. I also found that there are big distributions between station popularity in general as well as station popularity for use as a starting point or ending point. I found that customer user types tend to use different station pairs depending on the month, and that some months show higher variance in station pairs than others.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> I would like to focus on month to month analysis for my data report. Initially looking at gerneal popularity of the service each month, and then looking at variance in user type and station pair frequency per month.
